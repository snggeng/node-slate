# Introduction

Welcome to the Hypothetical Meals API documentation. This is the API used by the official Hypothetical Meals web interface, so everything the web UI is able to do can also be accomplished via the API.

Hypothetical Meals is a Product Lifecycle Inventory Management software that runs on a noSQL database.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) using the [NodeJS Fork](https://github.com/sdelements/node-slate).

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:


```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens
